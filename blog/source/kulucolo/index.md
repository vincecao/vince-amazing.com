The prototype of project is project ZX, which first developed in Tieba, named [旧番补完计划吧](http://tieba.baidu.com/f?kw=旧番补完计划&ie=utf-8 "旧番补完计划").

The project also created a series of social acounts for further communications, e.g. [BiliBili](http://space.bilibili.com/3586567/#!/index "bili"), [ACfun](http://www.acfun.tv/u/1809651.aspx "acfun") and [Weibo](http://weibo.com/KuluColo "weibo").
