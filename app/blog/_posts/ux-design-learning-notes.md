# Prototyping

### Type

- Sketch
- Wireframe
- Mockup

## Sketch

- Drawing of the user interface

## Wireframe

- Grayscale high-level rendering of a user interface
- focused on information and overall layout

## Mockup

- Visual design including color, hierarchy and iconography

## Interactivity

Any interactive behavior occurring on the user interface that changes the state of the design or the flow

## Why?

- Test out flows and interfactions
- Validate design concepts
- Rapidly iterate through ideas

# Focus on the design, not the tool

## Why Prototype?

- Limit the expense of development
- Test out design concepts
- Refine usability of product
- Communication tool for the project team

## Considerations when selecting users

- Testing in person (where / what kind of testing)
- Testing remotely (screen sharing)

# Design process

- Design Council Double Diamond

# Fidelity

refer to **visual appearance** / **degree of functionality**

**low-fidelity** ⇒ Sketch

**low-fidelity** ⇒ Wireframe (low polished, minimum fidelity)

**medium-fidelity** ⇒ color / some key feature, but lacking feedback from user

**high-fidelity** ⇒ can be real product, might receive feedback

## Low fidelity

**Advantage**

- user more like to be open with feedbacks
- easy to create with little time or effort
- easy to iterate quickly on the feedback

**Disadv**

- limited flow and interaction behavior
- Facilitator driven
- doesn't validate usability

**Questions could be high level**:

- What do you think of this idea?

## Medium / High fidelity

**Adv**

- More representative of look and feel
- Deisgn doesn't rely on a facilitator
- Usablility issues will be caught

**DisAdv**

- take more time to create
- user might not be willing to give feedback
- difficult to update

**Questions more on product**

- What you think this xxx does? (point out some non-functional key feature)
- Could you find item you want to purchased with and add into cart
